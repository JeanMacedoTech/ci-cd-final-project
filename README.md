# CI/CD Tools and Practices Final Project | Git Actions, Tekton and OpenShift Pipelines

This repository contains the template used for the Final Project for the Coursera course **CI/CD Tools and Practices**.

## Tasks performed

1) Created a full workflow for Nosetests unit testing and Flake8 linting to display code quality on commit as CI practices with Git Actions;
2) Used Tekton to create CD tasks for linting, unit testing, and building an application image;
3) Created an OpenShift Pipeline using the previously created Tekton steps;
4) Created a deploy step to the OpenShift pipeline, deploying the code to the lab's OpenShift cluster.
